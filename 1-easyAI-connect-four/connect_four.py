"""
How to set up the game:
---
Please install easyAI with `pip3 install easyAI`
and run the game with: `python3 connect_four.py`


How to play:
---
The goal of the game is for the user to get 4 of his checkers
in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
before the AI does it.
The user sets the checker with giving the column number 0-6 in his turn.
The checker is always set at the first available space counting from bottom.
